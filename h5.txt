Making a game in a group of 2 or 3 people.

Final due date: Sept 10, though you need to get started sooner.

Why: force you to talk to another person in the class, do something open-ended where you can ask me to help more if needed.

Points: 15 total
* 5 points is good programming style, see https://cs.indstate.edu/wiki/index.php/Programming_Style_-_Generic
* 10 points is functionality - does the program do what I asked you to complete


** Groups **
Your group - you can pick your group or ask to be assigned to a group.

Group work - you can choose one of the following ways to work together
      	   1) pair programming (aka extreme programming) - do everything together, take turns who types (really take turns)
	      * default - good because will catch each other's bugs, help each other out, talk through things
	   2) work in parallel with each of you keeping your own code base.
	   3) split up parts of the project to each work on

Sharing files - however you want to.  If you want to make a project directory that your partner can copy out of -
  cd ~
  chmod a+x .
  mkdir project
  chmod a+rx project
And your partner does
  cd ~cs202xy/project
  ls
Or OneDrive with shared folders.

*+- Update - see ~cs202/h5/README for information to fill out about the group work itself.  Those who did not do any work will not get any points.
*+- Note - every member of the group needs to submit the code for the assignment.  If you do not submit anything you do not get any points.

** What Game **
You propose a game to work on and then meet with / discuss with me to make up your initial plan.

Some ideas ...
- Any board game - chess, checkers, mancala, connect4, battleship, ...
- Any card game - go fish, poker, black jack, garbage, ...
- Quiz - math, spelling, trivia, ...
- Typing practice - speed, accuracy
- Simulation - planets, game of life, ...
- 2D World - with your person exploring the world
- Chatbot -
- Unit coversions -
- Calculator - 
- You name it

If you have something you have done previously in Python, it would be fine to do it now in C.


** First Steps **
1) Notify me of your group or that you want to be assigned a group.
2) Pick a time to meet from cs.indstate.edu/scheduler so I can give you a starting point.
